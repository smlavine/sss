# Sassy Square Sally
Sassy Square Sally is a free and open-source 2D platformer celebrating
minimalism, symmetry, ornaments and rectangles. The game caters to children,
beginners and casual players, aiming to provide a fun, easy and relaxing
experience rather than a difficult but rewarding challenge. In a complete
coincidence, my two little sisters fit all three categories.
