# Sassy Square Sally

Sassy Square Sally is a free and open-source 2D platformer.

It celebrates minimalism, symmetry, ornaments and rectangles.

The game caters to children, beginners and casual players.

It aims to provide a fun, easy and relaxing experience rather than a difficult but rewarding challenge.

In a complete coincidence, my two little sisters fit all three categories.

# Story

In the beginning we are introduced to a lovely tiny red square named Sally.

She engages into an exciting journey full of adventures and discoveries.

Her goal is to collect all the coins in all the little worlds she explores.

If she is feeling ambitious, she might challenge herself to do that as quickly as she can.

Deeper into the game the focus drifts from Sally to her many friends, different in size and shape.

Together, through the power of friendship and teamwork, they show how many can solve challenging puzzles that Sally alone could not.
